Measuring 250,000 tons dry weight, pound-for-pound Donnager-class battleships are one of the largest and most capable warships ever made.&nbsp;As the primary mainstay battleship classification in the MCRN, the Donnager-class serves multiple roles throughout the Sol System.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Complement</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">The Donnager-class is capable of hosting a crew complement of 2086 personnel, including squads of Martian Marines and their elite Force Recon units, equipped with Goliath Powered Armor. Thanks to the ship's interior hangar bay, located near the aft of the huge vessel, ships of this line can host their own escort ships in six interior ship berths. Each berth can hold one Corvette-class frigate or two Morrigan-class destroyers. The battleship additionally hosts a number of Chariot-type Dropships, repair skiffs and - depending on deployment - executive shuttlecraft.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Armament</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">The most notable elements of the Donnager-class complements are its two dorsal VX-12 \"Foehammer\" Turreted Ultra-Heavy Railguns. At the time of the class' construction, these weapons were amongst the highest-spec railguns in the Solar System and only matched by orbital weapons systems. Thanks to the foresight of MCRN engineers the Donnager-class hosts a total of four railgun hardpoints on its hull, capable of doubling the ship's railgun complement should such technological advancements allowing such an upgrade become available.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">The Donnager-class's other main weapons are its six fore and eight aft rapid-reload missile launchers, capable of attacking vessels in front of and behind the vessel. These launchers are linked to shared magazines of high explosive (HE), plasma, flechette, and nuclear warheads. For defense, the Donnager-class employs fifty-nine Nariman Dynamics 40mm PDCs, linked to the K-19 \"Banisher\" High-Accuracy Point Defense Targeting Computer, the most advanced target tracking system employed by the MCRN. Aside from its primary armaments, the Donnager-class serves as a capable command vessel in combat, with its ranging lasers and tactical systems to help guide and coordinate the efforts of fleet elements against hostile ships. In the event that a Donnager-class battleship is boarded by hostiles, they are equipped with a 'Condition Zero' fail-safe protocol, which will scuttle the ship, ensuring the ship cannot fall into enemy hands.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Utilities</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Sophisticated Medilab Facility</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Large Cargo Bays</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Pressure Sealed CIC (Combat Information Center)</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Redundant CIC Facilities</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Maximum Security Brig</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Onboard MMC Barracks and Armories</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">High Power Ranging Lasers</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Banisher High-Accuracy Point Defense Targeting Computer</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">High Power Range finding Lasers</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Sophisticated Fleetwide Communications Systems</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">Torpedo Rapid-Autoloading Mechanisms</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #191813;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">SPOILERS FOLLOW</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #191813;\">At the time of the UN-MCR War, nine Donnager-class vessels existed in the Sol System before the Attack on the Donnager, serving in a variety of roles including fleet command and coordination, battleship, force projection, and carrier of gunships and infantry.</span></p>","_id":"SkX0P8ifYhnQvnk8"}
