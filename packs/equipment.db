A well-rounded weapon that possesses decent handling, damage, and accuracy. It possesses the ability to fire in 3-round bursts, as well as a mediocre rate-of-fire and a rather low damage drop-off. That being said, it is still suitable for mid-to-long range engagements.</p>\n<p>The NV5 is a forward-ejecting Bullpup design. Forward-ejecting allows the NV5 to be a truly ambidextrous 7.62 Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The NV5 is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51 mm caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The NV5 is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with an A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec attachment rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the NV5 comes with a two-point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities/Flaws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AUTOMATIC</strong>: The weapon reloads and fires auto- matically so long as its trigger is depressed.

A well-rounded weapon that possesses decent handling, damage, and accuracy. It possesses the ability to fire in 3-round bursts, as well as a mediocre rate-of-fire and a rather low damage drop-off. That being said, it is still suitable for mid-to-long range engagements.</p>\n<p>The NV5c is a forward-ejecting Bullpup design. Forward-ejecting allows the NV5c to be a truly ambidextrous 7.62 Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The NV5c is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51 mm caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The NV5c is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with an A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec attachment rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the NV5c comes with a two-point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities/Flaws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DURRABLE</strong>: The item is built to last.

Two and a half meters tall and weighing 400 kilograms even before a soldier climbs inside, power armor provides both a formidable offense and defense. Half armor and half spacesuit, the armor has radiation shielding sufficient to let soldiers walk through a nuclear bomb crater minutes after the blast. The armor&rsquo;s titanium and ceramic-composite exterior shielding is typically painted with camouflage patterns appropriate to the assignment, and enemies are often surprised just how well an enormous soldier in power armor can blend into the environment when they stand still.</p>\n<p>The armor&rsquo;s hydraulics system magnifies the wearer&rsquo;s strength, much like a mech rig, and carries most of the weight of the suit, allowing soldiers in power armor to undertake marathon hikes and move surprisingly fast. They also enable the armor to carry heavy weaponry, typically a rotary machine gun and sometimes a grenade launcher or micro-missile pack. Sensor packages feed data to the wearer on the helmet&rsquo;s HUD, allowing them to identify and track infrared targeting lasers used by opponents&rsquo; weapons, and even visually parse those weapons using the suit&rsquo;s camera feeds to match them against an internal database. Those same cameras monitor in all directions, sending feeds back to squad officers and their mili- tary command center, which can monitor the life signs of both the<br />soldiers and opponents who have been detected and attacked.</p>\n<p>Despite all these capabilities, power armor is still designed for maneuverability in tight spaces, enabling infantry to move in microgravity and storm their way through the narrow confines of ships. Less so is a newer addition to the Martian arsenal: 4-meter tall, 9-ton combat mechs, walking tanks carrying rail guns and missiles adapted from ship weapon systems. They are strictly for ground-assault troops, and there are few installations or opponents able to stand against them for long.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 79\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If power armor loses power, it becomes massive deadweight, effectively leaving the wearer restrained and unable to use any of the armor&rsquo;s systems.</p>\n<p>Power armor requires regular maintenance activities during interludes to remain in full working order (see <strong>Interludes</strong> in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>).&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In The Expanse game terms, power armor grants the wearer the following:</p>\n<p>Qualities/Flaws:</p>\n<p><strong>ARMOR</strong>: +12 armor bonus with no armor penalty, so long as the armor is operational.</p>\n<p><strong>PHYSICAL ENHANCEMENT</strong>: +10 effective bonus to Strength and Strength(Might) tests.</p>\n<p><strong>MOBILITY ENHANCEMENT:</strong> +2 bonus to Speed and +4 bonus to Constitution (Endurance) tests.</p>\n<p><strong>WEAPONRY</strong>: An integral rifle doing 3d6 + Perception damage and capable of performing automatic weapon gun stunts.

Two and a half meters tall and weighing 400 kilograms even before a soldier climbs inside, power armor provides both a formidable offense and defense. Half armor and half spacesuit, the armor has radiation shielding sufficient to let soldiers walk through a nuclear bomb crater minutes after the blast. The armor&rsquo;s titanium and ceramic-composite exterior shielding is typically painted with camouflage patterns appropriate to the assignment, and enemies are often surprised just how well an enormous soldier in power armor can blend into the environment when they stand still.</p>\n<p>The armor&rsquo;s hydraulics system magnifies the wearer&rsquo;s strength, much like a mech rig, and carries most of the weight of the suit, allowing soldiers in power armor to undertake marathon hikes and move surprisingly fast. They also enable the armor to carry heavy weaponry, typically a rotary machine gun and sometimes a grenade launcher or micro-missile pack. Sensor packages feed data to the wearer on the helmet&rsquo;s HUD, allowing them to identify and track infrared targeting lasers used by opponents&rsquo; weapons, and even visually parse those weapons using the suit&rsquo;s camera feeds to match them against an internal database. Those same cameras monitor in all directions, sending feeds back to squad officers and their mili- tary command center, which can monitor the life signs of both the<br />soldiers and opponents who have been detected and attacked.</p>\n<p>Despite all these capabilities, power armor is still designed for maneuverability in tight spaces, enabling infantry to move in microgravity and storm their way through the narrow confines of ships. Less so is a newer addition to the Martian arsenal: 4-meter tall, 9-ton combat mechs, walking tanks carrying rail guns and missiles adapted from ship weapon systems. They are strictly for ground-assault troops, and there are few installations or opponents able to stand against them for long.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div title=\"Page 79\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>If power armor loses power, it becomes massive deadweight, effectively leaving the wearer restrained and unable to use any of the armor&rsquo;s systems.</p>\n<p>Power armor requires regular maintenance activities during interludes to remain in full working order (see <strong>Interludes</strong> in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>).&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In The Expanse game terms, power armor grants the wearer the following:</p>\n<p>Qualities/Flaws:</p>\n<p><strong>ARMOR</strong>: +12 armor bonus with no armor penalty, so long as the armor is operational.</p>\n<p><strong>PHYSICAL ENHANCEMENT</strong>: +10 effective bonus to Strength and Strength(Might) tests.</p>\n<p><strong>MOBILITY ENHANCEMENT:</strong> +2 bonus to Speed and +4 bonus to Constitution (Endurance) tests.</p>\n<p><strong>WEAPONRY</strong>: An integral rifle doing 3d6 + Perception damage and capable of performing automatic weapon gun stunts.
