A modern hand grenade generally consists of an explosive charge (\"filler\"), a detonator mechanism, an internal striker to trigger the detonator, and a safety lever secured by a linchpin. The user pulls the safety pin before throwing, and once thrown the safety lever gets released, allowing the striker to trigger a primer that ignites a fuze (sometimes called the delay element), which burns down to the detonator and explodes the main charge.</p>\n<p>Grenades work by dispersing shrapnel (fragmentation grenades), shockwave (high explosive, stun and anti-tank grenades), chemical aerosols (smoke and gas grenades) and flammables (incendiary grenades). Fragmentation grenades (or \"frags\") are probably the most common in modern armies, and when the word grenade is used colloquially, it is generally assumed to refer to a fragmentation grenade. Their outer casings, generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel, are designed to rupture and fragmentize on detonation, sending out numerous fragments (shards and splinters) as fast-flying projectiles. In modern grenades, a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade is commonly used, which may be spherical, cuboid, wire or notched wire. Most anti-personnel (AP) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact.</p>\n<p>Grenades are typically oval/round-shaped with a \"pineapple\" or \"baseball\" appearance that fits the grasp of a normal-sized hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Range</strong>: Strength*10 meters.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect Radius</strong>:&nbsp;The&nbsp;kill radius&nbsp;of your typical fragmentation&nbsp;grenade&nbsp;is 5 meters, the casualty&nbsp;radius is 15 meters, but shrapnel can travel as far as 230 meters.</p>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 77\">\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Deals 3d6 of WOUND damage to all affected within the kill radius, with damage falling off by 1d6 for each additional range band (2d6 to those affected between 5 and 10 meters away, 1d6 to those affected between 10 and 15 meters away).</p>\n<p>All affected characters are required to immediately roll a <strong>TN 13 Constitution</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Stamina</strong>) test.
