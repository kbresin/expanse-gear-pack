Earbuds or a headset allow a wearer to privately listen to audio feeds or communicate and control the terminal sub-vocally via built- in microphones.

Tools are necessary for tests involving the following focuses: Communication (Disguise), Dexterity (Crafting), and Intelligence (Demolitions, Engineering, Research, or Technology). Without the necessary tools, char- acters cannot easily perform tasks involving those focuses; it&rsquo;s hard to create a disguise out of nothing and harder still to repair a reactor or hack a network without the right equipment!</p>\n<p>Normally, tools simply enable characters to perform their associated tasks but, like other equipment, good tools may have certain qualities and poor or makeshift tools may have certain flaws, affecting how useful those tools are. So an engineer with a Fine and Effective workshop has a better chance of success and creates more effective work, while a spy making do with a Slow and Shoddy disguise kit takes longer to prepare and has a penalty in terms of carrying out the deception.</p>\n<p>This workshop is equipped with all the basic tools needed to use the Intelligence (Technology) focus. Without such tools tests against this focus can't be perfromed.</p>","weight":0,"cost":"10","quantity":1,"equiped":false,"itemMods":{"itemDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"actorDamage":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"itemActivation":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"focus":{"name":"","value":0,"isActive":false},"defense":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"impactArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"ballisticArmor":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"toughness":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"speed":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"defendMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"guardupMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"allOutAtkMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxHealth":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxConviction":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"maxPowerPoints":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"powerForce":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"aimMnv":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"armorPenalty":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"acc":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"comm":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cons":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"cunn":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"dex":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"fight":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"int":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"magic":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"per":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"str":{"value":0,"isActive":false},"will":{"value":0,"isActive":false}}},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.mW0olbRU8vjq9IL3"}},"img":"modules/expanse-gear-pack/item-assets/tools/table.svg","effects":[]}
