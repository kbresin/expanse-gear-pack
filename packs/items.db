A well-rounded weapon that possesses decent handling, damage, and accuracy. It possesses the ability to fire in 3-round bursts, as well as a mediocre rate-of-fire and a rather low damage drop-off. That being said, it is still suitable for mid-to-long range engagements.</p>\n<p>The NV5 is a forward-ejecting Bullpup design. Forward-ejecting allows the NV5 to be a truly ambidextrous 7.62 Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The NV5 is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51 mm caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The NV5 is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with an A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec attachment rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the NV5 comes with a two-point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities/Flaws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AUTOMATIC</strong>: The weapon reloads and fires auto- matically so long as its trigger is depressed.

Two and a half meters tall and weighing 400 kilograms even before a soldier climbs inside, power armor provides both a formidable offense and defense. Half armor and half spacesuit, the armor has radiation shielding sufficient to let soldiers walk through a nuclear bomb crater minutes after the blast. The armor&rsquo;s titanium and ceramic-composite exterior shielding is typically painted with camouflage patterns appropriate to the assignment, and enemies are often surprised just how well an enormous soldier in power armor can blend into the environment when they stand still.</p>\n<p>The armor&rsquo;s hydraulics system magnifies the wearer&rsquo;s strength, much like a mech rig, and carries most of the weight of the suit, allowing soldiers in power armor to undertake marathon hikes and move surprisingly fast. They also enable the armor to carry heavy weaponry, typically a rotary machine gun and sometimes a grenade launcher or micro-missile pack. Sensor packages feed data to the wearer on the helmet&rsquo;s HUD, allowing them to identify and track infrared targeting lasers used by opponents&rsquo; weapons, and even visually parse those weapons using the suit&rsquo;s camera feeds to match them against an internal database. Those same cameras monitor in all directions, sending feeds back to squad officers and their mili- tary command center, which can monitor the life signs of both the<br />soldiers and opponents who have been detected and attacked.</p>\n<p>Despite all these capabilities, power armor is still designed for maneuverability in tight spaces, enabling infantry to move in microgravity and storm their way through the narrow confines of ships. Less so is a newer addition to the Martian arsenal: 4-meter tall, 9-ton combat mechs, walking tanks carrying rail guns and missiles adapted from ship weapon systems.

Its rounds impact almost instantly on targets within 1000 km. The Truman-class dreadnought is armed with 2 turret-mounted high-yield Farren-Pattern Railguns mounted opposite of each other on the dorsal and ventral hull.</p>\n<p>A railgun is a powerful ship-to-ship weapon used by the United Nations Navy, the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, the Outer Planets Alliance, and Protogen Corporation for space combat</p>\n<p>Railguns are large, powerful mass drivers, cannons that use electroconductive rails and the Lorentz Effect to accelerate a dense metal slug at very high speeds, relying on mass and sheer speed to punch clean through ships rather than warheads like with torpedoes. These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"5d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_uhc5vjt8h3"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]}

A well-rounded weapon that possesses decent handling, damage, and accuracy. It possesses the ability to fire in 3-round bursts, as well as a mediocre rate-of-fire and a rather low damage drop-off. That being said, it is still suitable for mid-to-long range engagements.</p>\n<p>The NV5c is a forward-ejecting Bullpup design. Forward-ejecting allows the NV5c to be a truly ambidextrous 7.62 Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The NV5c is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62x51 mm caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18\" model to be only 26.1\" long, or as much as 14\" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The NV5c is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with an A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec attachment rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work \"drop free\" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the NV5c comes with a two-point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualities/Flaws:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DURRABLE</strong>: The item is built to last.

Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area.

While requiring the ship to turn and aim the cannon, these gave a comparatively small warship a massive amount of firepower.</p>\n<p>A railgun is a powerful ship-to-ship weapon used by the United Nations Navy, the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, the Outer Planets Alliance, and Protogen Corporation for space combat</p>\n<p>Railguns are large, powerful mass drivers, cannons that use electroconductive rails and the Lorentz Effect to accelerate a dense metal slug at very high speeds, relying on mass and sheer speed to punch clean through ships rather than warheads like with torpedoes. These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_uhc5vjt8h3"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]}
