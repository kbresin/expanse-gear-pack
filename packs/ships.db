However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area. For this reason, the use of missiles in CQB is avoided.</p>\n<p>Being the standard armament on combat vessels, even ships small enough to not be fitted with rail guns can carry missiles. Frigates, corvettes, and patrol boats have one or two firing tubes. Larger ships like cruisers, battleships, and dreadnoughts carry between 3 and 10 tubes.</p>\n<p>Torpedoes follow the direction of shipboard targeting lasers used to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; an enemy, switching over to their own internal guidance systems when necessary.

The ship is propelled by a supercharged Destrier-4 high-velocity Epstein Drive, extensively tuned to improve acceleration, and constantly maintained by multi-injection hyper-coolant units to prevent thermal overload.

However, much of this advantage is lost.</p>\n<p>Despite its small size, the Leonidas-class suffers from poor acceleration resulting from its low-quality S-250 series Epstein drives, units considered outdated even before ships of this class entered service. Low-quality targeting suites also affect the efficiency of its torpedoes and point defense cannons (PDCs) negatively, requiring more to be added to increase effective point defense and torpedo impact probability in a sort of \"spray'n'pray\" mentality. This, however, further weighed the ship down and made it even slower. The ship's poor agility mixed with its sluggish acceleration rightfully earned the class the nicknames \"Lead Leos\" or \"Brick Buckets.\"</p>\n<p>Unlike Martian PDC techniques, the 25 Mikazuki Munitions PDCs aren't able to be retracted into the battleships hull, exposing them to impact damage. However, this does give them slightly more reaction time in certain situations.</p>\n<p>In addition to these problems, its railguns cannot be adjusted while under thrust, forcing the ship to strafe an engagement zone at a drift or even coming to a relative stop once within engagement range.</p>\n<p>The ship does have some positive traits; it is practically unreachable by torpedos due to its relatively small size and high concentration of PDCs, and it is considered effective as an assault ship with its modular troop barracks and sizable M-type dropships, allowing it to carry and deploy more UN Marines than even some dedicated assault craft. However, its sluggishness makes it vulnerable to railguns, especially as its own railguns are heavily outranged by most other ships carrying them.</p>\n<p>Overall, while still a somewhat reliable warship, the slow, heavy, and poorly planned Leonidas-class stands as a symbol of the once prideful, United Nations Navy's, fall into complete stagnancy, in dire need for a drastic overhaul.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>:&nbsp;Minor Command Ship, UNMC Heavy Troop Carrier, Force Projection Vessel.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilities</strong></p>\n<p>Large Cargo Holds, Onboard UNMC Barracks, Extensive Medical Facilities, Passive and Direct Scanning systems, Fleet-grade communication system.</p>\n<p><strong>Armament</strong></p>\n<p>The Leonidas is armed with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 ✕ Dawson-Pattern Medium Railguns (Cannot be articulated under thrust)</li>\n<li>32 ✕ Single-Fire Torpedo Tubes (Conventional, Plasma, and Nuclear Warheads)</li>\n<li>25 ✕ Mikazuki Munitions Point Defense Cannons</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Craft</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 ✕ M-Type Dropship Skiffs</li>\n<li>Occasionally UN One (Government Shuttlecraft)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","passengers":[],"crew":{"min":1,"current":512,"typical":1,"competence":"4"},"weapons":{},"systems":{"maneuver":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"dex","useFocus":""},"command":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"comm","useFocus":""},"sensors":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"int","useFocus":""},"damageControl":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","TN":11,"useAbl":"int","useFocus":"","threshold":{"current":0,"target":5}}},"losses":{"normal":{"collateral":{"actual":0,"max":6},"hull":{"actual":0,"max":6},"maneuverability":{"actual":0,"max":6},"sensors":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weapons":{"actual":0,"max":6}},"serious":{"reactorOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weaponOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6}}},"takenOut":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/item-assets/ships/Leonidasclassconceptart.jpeg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Leonidas-Class Battleship","displayName":50,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/Expanse_Ships/Escort_ship_104m_token.png","tint":"","width":6,"height":6,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"G2WjTbcaJk115A7I","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"KLqe0eO6By6jT4z9","name":"Torpedo Launcher 1","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p>The longest-range weapons are self-guided torpedoes, essentially a tiny Epstein Drive carrying an explosive warhead.

Famed for its sturdiness, and reliability, it is one of the longest-serving vessels in the history of the UNN, having protected Earth's interests across the system for decades.</p>\n<p>The Truman-class dreadnought is armed with 2 Farren-Pattern high-yield heavy railgun turrets, each armed with a pair of adjustable Farren-Pattern high-yield heavy railguns that are able to inflict lethal damage over vast distances and are some of the most powerful and accurate weapons systems available to the UNN. Matched only by the highly advanced MCRN railguns and the UNN Orbital Railgun Platforms, the Truman's railguns are able to strike a target almost instantaneously when fired from within 1000 kilometers, launching an unguided tungsten projectile that will effortlessly perforate the full mass of the targeted craft, tearing through multiple decks and often striking a critical subsystem to neutralize the target vessel in a single shot. These weapons are supported by 42 Redfield Ballistics 40 mm Point Defense Cannons (PDC), spread across the surface of the dreadnought for maximum defensive coverage, as well as 9 autoloading torpedo bays compatible with a variety of warheads. The effective targeting range of the Truman-class is shorter than that of most MCRN warships but its extensive PDC grid enables it to endure even the largest torpedo volleys, protecting the ship from harm while coordinating fleet movements or bringing her railguns to bear. Unlike the style of Martian warships, the PDCs of the Truman-class dreadnoughts don't seem to be retractable in the vessel's hull itself. This would make its PDCs have more reaction time in some situations, however it does put its PDCs at risk of impact damage.</p>\n<p>A pair of hangar bays and accompanying external docking clamps are located in the midsection of the Truman-class, where its complement of 6 L-Type UNN dropship skiffs, as well as a smaller number of short-range repair skiffs and reconnaissance drones are housed. Though the Truman-class is not quite large enough to carry corvettes in its internal hangars like the MCRN Donnager-class battleships, its embarked dropships widen its mission profile to include Marine deployment and surface reconnaissance.</p>\n<p>The class shows its age in several ways, such as naked pipes and wires above corridors and constant electrical issues. The circular CIC of the class is however perhaps the most notable example of the ships age, as it makes use of computers operated with keyboards, switches and sticks rather than touchscreens and holographic interfaces as seen aboard MCRN ships and other more modern ships. However, many may have been upgraded to include touchscreen and holographic interfaces as such with the UNN Thomas Prince.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of its most valuable traits, its versatility, an attribute that has stood the test of time, surely is the \"crown jewel\" of the ship. Few vessels are able to serve as both a battleship and a troop transport without sacrificing effectiveness in both areas, but the streamlined design of the Truman-class allows the vessel to carry out missions that would otherwise require a small flotilla. This high level of adaptability has earned the Truman-class its impressive reputation, and serves as an enduring reminder that technological sophistication is often no substitute for a simple and reliable design.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilities</strong></p>\n<p>The Truman-class dreadnought contains many various facilities within for a warship this size.

At the time of the UN-MCR War, nine Donnager-class vessels existed in the Sol System before the Attack on the Donnager, serving in a variety of roles including fleet command and coordination, battleship, force projection, and carrier of gunships and infantry.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Complement</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Donnager-class is capable of hosting a crew complement of 2086 personnel, including squads of Martian Marines and their elite Force Recon units, equipped with Goliath Powered Armor. Thanks to the ship's interior hangar bay, located near the aft of the huge vessel, ships of this line can host their own escort ships in six interior ship berths. Each berth can hold one Corvette-class frigate or two Morrigan-class destroyers.[5] The battleship additionally hosts a number of Chariot-type Dropships, repair skiffs and - depending on deployment - executive shuttlecraft.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Armament</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The most notable elements of the Donnager-class complements are its two dorsal VX-12 \"Foehammer\" Turreted Ultra-Heavy Railguns. At the time of the class' construction, these weapons were amongst the highest-spec railguns in the Solar System and only matched by orbital weapons systems. Thanks to the foresight of MCRN engineers the Donnager-class hosts a total of four railgun hardpoints on its hull, capable of doubling the ship's railgun complement should such technological advancements allowing such an upgrade become available.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Destroyer and Corvette Docked Positions</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Donnager-class's other main weapons are its six fore and eight aft rapid-reload missile launchers, capable of attacking vessels in front of and behind the vessel. These launchers are linked to shared magazines of high-explosive (HE), plasma, flechette, and nuclear warheads. For defense, the Donnager-class employs fifty-nine Nariman Dynamics 40mm PDCs, linked to the K-19 \"Banisher\" High-Accuracy Point Defence Targeting Computer, the most advanced target tracking system employed by the MCRN. Aside from its primary armaments, the Donnager-class serves as a capable command vessel in combat, with its ranging lasers and tactical systems to help guide and coordinate the efforts of fleet elements against hostile ships. In the event that a Donnager-class battleship is boarded by hostiles, they are equipped with a 'Condition Zero' fail-safe protocol, which will scuttle the ship, ensuring the ship cannot fall into enemy hands.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in;

Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs.

Missiles are the standard primary armament on all warships.</p>\n<p>They are also referred to as \"torpedoes\" when used in ship-to-ship combat, or \"nukes\" when equipped with a nuclear warhead.</p>\n<p>Missiles are long-range, guided missile delivery systems that can be fitted with conventional explosives, plasma warheads (which melt armor and damage systems), flechette warheads (which penetrate ship armor better than an HE warhead, but not as well as a plasma warhead, and don more widespead systemic damage) or varying-yield nuclear warheads. They are jettisoned from the launcher, align themselves with the target, and then begin accelerating to high speed. They can accelerate far faster than a ship, are impossible to dodge, and cause devastating damage to a ship on contact, often wiping out smaller ships with a single hit.</p>\n<p>Their ability to maneuver grants them a much higher effective range than railguns. However, missiles do have a minimum range, so they are usually launched first in an engagement. Missiles are also vulnerable to point defense cannons (PDCs), which can intercept them before closing to effective range. This is countered by firing them in numbers to overwhelm the PDCs on an enemy ship.</p>\n<p>As is seen with the Canterbury's destruction, missiles can have the side-effect of turning the \"splashed\" ship into a destructive field of moving debris, posing a further threat to any other ship in the immediate area.

This is a byproduct of the ship's stealth functionality, using angular sheets of black composite materials to absorb or reflect radar signals. These materials are supported by active cooling systems to conceal the ship's detectable heat signature, able to reduce the frigate's ambient temperature to match that of an asteroid or even that of background radiation. This functionality is of course only available when the frigate's main drive is offline, as an engine burn of any kind would alert any nearby vessels to the ship's location.</p>\n<p>The Amun-Ra class is frightfully well armed for its size, and at the time of its commissioning, the class was the smallest vessel in history to be armed with a railgun. The ship's prototype S-24 Kopesh is internally mounted along the vessel's spine, however its railgun is significantly out ranged when to compared Martian and even some UNN warships. The railgun is supported by 4 retractable hyper cooled PDCs for maximum heat signature concealment and uninterrupted firing time, as well as a pair of concealed Missile bays, equipped with rapid reload systems. The standard crew complement of the Amun-Ra-class includes 50 personnel; however, this is frequently expanded to 100 for missions which include troop deployments or boarding actions. During such encounters, assault teams are deployed using the frigate's 15 breaching pods laid into the ship's broadsides. These pods function by launching a small breaching charge to weaken the hull of a target ship before clamping themselves into the surface using 3 mechanical claws, establishing an access passage for troops.</p>\n<p>The Amun-Ra-class carries a single Khonsu-class shuttlecraft, equipped with similar stealth features to the larger frigate. This shuttle is able to serve as a forward scout for the frigate capable of traveling impressively long distances from its mothership to transfer personnel or supplies. The craft is kept in a concealed compartment, nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the frigate's hull, and can be quickly deployed as an evacuation craft, in the event of an emergency.</p>\n<p>This formidable ship has a few weaknesses in combat: while being larger than a Martian frigate, it only has four PDCs, a somewhat small amount for a ship its size. Even six of these ships in close formation were unable to fully blunt a Donnager-class battleship's missile barrage, losing one of their six to torpedoes. The positioning of its PDCs, although allowing equal coverage, does not allow for overlapping fields of fire, and the when against the Corvette-class light frigate's agility, combined with the fact that it can fire all of it's six PDCs at a single target simultaneously, allowed the smaller ship to dance a tight circle around the Osiris and riddle it with her own PDCs without much return fire. The ship's light railgun is significantly out ranged by some Martian railguns and probably a handful of UNN railguns, as seen when Donnager's railguns were able to fire and score a kill well before the stealth frigates could get within range.</p>\n<p>Interior</p>\n<p>There is a central long corridor that has a \"storage closet\" off to the side, where Julie Mao is held captive.</p>\n<p>There is a T junction on both ends.</p>\n<p>The bridge design is of conventional design with grav-seats for an unknown complement of persons.</p>\n<p>There is a large open engineering area at the back of the ship where the reactor protrudes into the interior of the ship and which is an ideal location for growing protomolecule when it is not dormant.</p>\n<p>Presumably there are other corridors on the ship.</p>\n<p>A total of 9 Amun-Ra-class vessels were commissioned by Protogen, each named after a deity in Egyptian mythology. The first was the Amun-Ra itself, which served as a partially functional testbed for class's stealth systems and was later cannibalized to aid in the construction of further vessels.</p>\n<p>Six of the eight operational stealth frigates; Horus, Amunet, Apophis, Nephthys, Hathor, and Sobek were used to attack and board the MCRN Donnager prior to the Eros Incident but were destroyed in combat with the battleship or lost when the Donnager activated its 'Condition Zero' self-destruction protocol. An eighth vessel, the Anubis, was used in attacks against the ice freighters Canterbury and Scopuli. The last vessel of the class was the Osiris, which had served as a standing escort around Thoth Station and was later destroyed by the Rocinante during the OPA attack on the station.</p>\n<p>The Amun-Ra was a highly advanced warship. Commissioned by the Protogen corporation and assembled at Bush Shipyards on a secret contract for Protogen Corporation. Evidence implicates that the UN Undersecretary, Sadavir Errinwright, was complicit in authorizing the contract.</p>\n<p>Currently, all ships of this class have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","passengers":[],"crew":{"min":1,"current":1,"typical":1,"competence":"4"},"weapons":{},"systems":{"maneuver":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"dex","useFocus":""},"command":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"comm","useFocus":""},"sensors":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","useAbl":"int","useFocus":""},"damageControl":{"mod":0,"base":0,"operator":"crew","TN":11,"useAbl":"int","useFocus":"","threshold":{"current":0,"target":5}}},"losses":{"normal":{"collateral":{"actual":0,"max":6},"hull":{"actual":0,"max":6},"maneuverability":{"actual":0,"max":6},"sensors":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weapons":{"actual":0,"max":6}},"serious":{"reactorOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6},"weaponOffline":{"actual":0,"max":6}}},"takenOut":false},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/expanse-pack/item-assets/ships/Amun-raclassstealthshipconceptart.jpeg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Amun-Ra-class Stealth Frigate","displayName":50,"img":"modules/expanse-pack/token-assets/Expanse_Ships/Shandian_token.png","tint":"","width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"ydQkaSQXfm6ZagkR","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"rFPYY23SnMCrVfO0","name":"Rail Gun - S-24 Khopesh","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>S-24 \"Khopesh\" Light Railgun</strong></p>\n<p>The first ever railguns to be mounted onto a frigate-type vessel, one of these weapons was integrally mounted onto each of the Protogen Corporation's experimental Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates. While requiring the ship to turn and aim the cannon, these gave a comparatively small warship a massive amount of firepower.</p>\n<p>A railgun is a powerful ship-to-ship weapon used by the United Nations Navy, the Martian Congressional Republic Navy, the Outer Planets Alliance, and Protogen Corporation for space combat</p>\n<p>Railguns are large, powerful mass drivers, cannons that use electroconductive rails and the Lorentz Effect to accelerate a dense metal slug at very high speeds, relying on mass and sheer speed to punch clean through ships rather than warheads like with torpedoes. These weapons require significant power (typically supplied by a fusion power-plant) to fire and must charge briefly before firing. They range from light, fast firing railguns with small calibers (presumably around 40 millimeters) to ultra-heavy types, firing heavier slugs on a lower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>Railguns are typically spinal weapons that require the ship to turn and face the target to aim the weapon. This is the case with Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigate, the Rocinante after her upgrade and UNN Railgun Platforms. Larger ships, however, can carry turreted railguns. The MCRN's Donnager-class battleships and UNN's Leonidas-class battleships and Truman-class dreadnought carry pairs of railgun turrets, allowing them to more easily engage targets without having to rotate the ship.</p>\n<p>Railgun shots are powerful and accurate high-energy kinetic penetrators, operating in the kiloton or even megaton range, capable of shooting clean through even large ships and doing critical damage, depending on their caliber and point of impact. Super-heavy railguns, mounted on battleships, are able to obliterate smaller ships with a single hit, as shown by the MCRN Donnager against an Amun-Ra frigate. Smaller railguns are also able to cripple bigger ships, if enough hits are acquired, and inflict severe damage on smaller units, taking them out with few well-placed slugs. However, in those cases, if the round does not hit any critical components, it will simply perforate the ship being attacked, leaving small holes that can be plugged relatively easily, such as when Naomi Nagata sealed a hole aboard the Donnager with an instruction manual and specialized adhesive.</p>\n<p>Though powerful and with technically almost unlimited range in space because of Newtons first law, railguns are limited in their effective range against targets in motion. Because while the round is quite fast but unguided, it can be dodged comfortably at longer ranges, although slower ships like the Leonidas-class or the OPA Behemoth are more vulnerable. As a result, the use of railguns requires a sure lock and high accuracy in order to prevent misfires. Railguns are therefore used almost exclusively in CQB (close quarter battles) because there is no way to evade them or misfire in this situation. Because of their short-range lethality, it was considered suicidal to attack spacecraft such as a Donnager-class battleship at close range.</p>\n<p>Against immobile or very slow-moving targets however, the effective range is almost unlimited, and in this scenario railguns are very effective long range weapons capable in destroying their target over a distance of millions of kilometers. The UNN proved this, when 5 of their orbital railgun platforms destroyed all 5 of the MCRN C Stealth ballistic missile platforms positioned against Earth, during the UN-MCR War.</p>\n</div>","weight":0,"cost":0,"quantity":1,"equiped":false,"dmgType":"stun","dmgSource":"impact","nrDice":"1","diceType":"6","extraValue":0,"dmgAbl":"str","type":"weapon","damage":"3d6","sensorMod":0,"maneuverSizeStep":0,"juiceMod":0,"hullPlating":0,"hullMod":0,"useFocus":"","useAbl":"","quality":"quality","isActive":true},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.2ck7xl3Qlpm4v0Hz"}},"img":"systems/age-system/resources/imgs/item-icon/processor.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bhFNtIklaUSgVLnB","name":"PDC - Bush Shipyards Hypercooled","type":"shipfeatures","data":{"shortDesc":"","longDesc":"<div title=\"Page 125\">\n<p><strong>Bush Shipyards Hypercooled Point Defense Cannons</strong></p>\n<p>PDC turrets specifically designed by the Bush shipyards for Protogen's Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates.
