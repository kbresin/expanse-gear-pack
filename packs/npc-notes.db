You can also create more robust combat drones by applying the guidelines under Adversary Improvement to the stats given here to create Major and higher threat level drones.</p>\n<p>You can treat some combat drones as having no Fortune score, but being capable of taking multiple injured and wounded conditions to deal with damage that gets past their armor, until the drone suffers enough losses to be rendered non-functional.</p>\n</div>","_id":"ih5lqtRRoJ5UQ3vo"}
